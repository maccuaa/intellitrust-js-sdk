    "description": "# IntelliTrust API documentation\nThis document describes how to control access to your application using IntelliTrust Authentication API calls.\n# Prerequisites\nConfirm the following before configuring your application to use the API calls included in this guide:\n\n 1. An Authentication API application has been created within IntelliTrust.\n 2. A resource rule has been created for your Authentication API application.\n 3. Each user who will access the application has an IntelliTrust account.\n 4. Each user who will access the IntelliTrust application has had all of their authenticators assigned to them and activated.\n\n# IntelliTrust Authentication APIs\nIntelliTrust uses three API calls to complete an authentication challenge:\n\n 1. Get User's Authenticators\n 2. Select Authenticator\n 3. Complete Authentication Challenge\n\nThese API calls must be made sequentially to complete IntelliTrust authentication. Information is provided in response to each API call that is required to complete the next call. Completing each of these API calls in order allows users to log in to the application.\n\n# List of supported Authenticators\nThe following authenticators are supported for authentication using IntelliTrust API calls:\n\n - Passwords\n - Knowledge-based authentication (KBA)\n - Temporary Access Codes\n - One-time passcodes (OTP)\n\t-\tOTPs can also be dynamically linked with transaction details when used with Authentication API applications for PSD2 (Payment Service Directive).\n - Grid cards\n - Hardware and software tokens\n\t-\tTokens supporting signatures can also be dynamically linked with transaction detail values when used with Authentication API applications for PSD2.\n - Entrust Soft Token Push authentication\n - Mobile Smart Credential Push authentication\n\n Although FIDO2 authentication is supported by IntelliTrust for authentication to SAML and OIDC applications as well as to the user and administration portals, it is not yet supported in the authentication API.\n\nThe next section describes how to authenticate through API calls using some of the authenticators listed above. These examples involve single-factor authentication. See **Two-factor Authentication** for assistance with using IntelliTrust's Authentication APIs to facilitate two-factor authentication.\n\n## Transaction Details\nWhen using a push authenticator, such as Entrust Soft Token Push authentication or Mobile Smart Credential Push authentication, transaction details may be included in the challenge request. A transaction detail consists of a detail name and a value. Transaction details are passed to the mobile device and displayed to the user when confirming authentication.\n\nWhen using an OTP authenticator with Authentication API applications for PSD2, the OTP is dynamically linked with transaction details. The transaction details are included in the challenge request. A transaction detail consists of a detail name and a value. IntelliTrust generates a new, specific OTP tied directly to the request and transaction details. The OTP is then sent to the user using Email or SMS messaging. The user reviews the transaction details and uses the associated OTP to complete the authentication challenge.\n\nWhen using a TOKEN authenticator with Authentication API applications for PSD2, the token response is dynamically linked with transaction detail values. The transaction details are included in the challenge request. A transaction detail consists of a detail name and a value. The user reviews the transaction details and enters the transaction values (consecutively) into the token and obtains the signature. The signature is then used to complete the authentication challenge.\n\nThe following restrictions apply to transaction details:\n\n - The detail name cannot be duplicated.\n - The length of the detail name and value cannot exceed 255 characters.\n - The number of transaction details cannot exceed 25.\n\nWhen dynamically linking transaction details with Authentication API applications that use an OTP authenticator or TOKEN authenticator for PSD2, the same transaction details must be specified in both the user challenge (Select authenticator) request and the user authenticate (Complete authentication challenge) request. They must match.\n\nWhen using transaction details with push authentication as part of the user challenge (Select authenticator) request, the use of the same transaction details can be optionally specified in the user authenticate (Complete authentication challenge) request. If specified, they must match.\n\nWhen using the transaction details, it is recommended that the transaction details are always supplied in both the user challenge (Select authenticator) request and the user authenticate (Complete authentication challenge) request. This is mandatory for PSD2 authentications.\n\nTo use transaction details with a push authenticator or an OTP authenticator API applications for PSD2, the request user challenge body should contain a JSON object with an array of these details. For example:\n```\n\"transactionDetails\":[\n\t{\"detail\":\"Account\",\"value\":\"67432\"},\n\t{\"detail\":\"Amount\",\"value\":\"$10,001\"},\n\t{\"detail\":\"Purpose\",\"value\":\"Transfer\"}\n],\n```\n\nTo use transaction details with a TOKEN authenticator API applications for PSD2, the request user challenge body should contain a JSON object with an array of these details. Some tokens may only support numeric transaction values. For example:\n```\n\"transactionDetails\":[\n\t{\"detail\":\"Account\",\"value\":\"67432\"},\n\t{\"detail\":\"Amount\",\"value\":\"10001\"}\n],\n```\n# Examples\n## OTP\n### Get User's Authenticators\nThe first step is to submit a POST request to get all of the authenticators that can be used to log in to the application. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"userId\":\"jsmith\",\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\"}\n```\nAn API response is received after entering the request. For example:\n```\n {\n        \"availableSecondFactor\": null,\n        \"userMachineSettings\": {\n            \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n            \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n            \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n            \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n        },\n        \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n        \"authenticationTypes\": [\n            \"OTP\",\n            \"TOKEN\"\n        ],\n        \"time\": 1520961989641,\n        \"otpDeliveryInfo\": {\n            \"otpDefaultDelivery\": \"SMS\",\n            \"availableOTPDelivery\": [\n                \"SMS\",\n                \"EMAIL\",\n                \"VOICE\"\n            ]\n        }\n  }\n```\nThe authenticator types listed in the response are those that can be used to complete an authentication challenge and log in. **authenticationTypes** lists all of the authenticators that have been assigned to the user and can be used to complete a first-factor authentication challenge. **availableSecondFactor** lists the authenticators that can be used to complete a second authentication challenge after the user has completed a first-factor challenge. The authenticators listed as **authenticationTypes** and **availableSecondFactor** are defined by cross referencing the authenticators assigned to the user with those the application’s resource rule allows to be used for authentication.\n### Select Authenticator\nThe next step is to select which authenticator to use from those listed in the previous API response. The authenticator is selected by entering a POST request. That request must be sent to the correct URL with the name of authenticator at the end. The URL is different for each authenticator that you want to select using the API call. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users/authenticate/OTP\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"userId\":\"jsmith\",\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\"}\n```\nAn API response is received after entering the request. For example:\n```\n {\n    \"status\": null,\n    \"firstName\": null,\n    \"lastName\": null,\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": false,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": {\n        \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": false,\n        \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n        \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n        \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n    },\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": \"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\",\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": \"SMS\",\n    \"expires\": 1520966778923,\n    \"time\": 1520965879202\n}\n```\nOnce an authentication type is selected through the API call, IntelliTrust also provides the information necessary to complete the authentication challenge. For example, if OTP is selected, IntelliTrust generates an OTP and sends it to the user so they can complete the authentication challenge. If **kbaChallenge** is selected, IntelliTrust generates the questions that must be answered to authenticate.\n### Complete authentication challenge\nThe last step is to complete the authentication process. The response for the requested authentication must be included in the last API call. For example, a POST request for OTP would be sent to:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/authentication/users/authenticate/OTP/complete\n```\nThe request must include the end user’s response to the authentication challenge. For example, the OTP received by the user must be included in the request to complete an OTP challenge.\nThe URL must contain the selected authenticator (for example, OTP). An Authorization header field must be added in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as \"token\" in the last request.\n\nThe body of this request should contain the Application ID and authenticator response. For example:\n```\n{\n   \"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\",\n   \"response\":\"123454665\"\n}  \n```\nAn API response is received after entering the request. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"status\": null,\n    \"firstName\": \"John\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": true,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": null,\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": \"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\",\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n    \"expires\": 1520968457173,\n    \"time\": 1520967582294\n}\n```\nIntelliTrust receives the request once it is entered and validates it.\n\nIn the example above, **authenticationCompleted** is marked as true because the response sent in the post request was valid.\n\nThe response from the call would indicate a failure if an invalid value is passed in the body of the response. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"errorCode\": \"invalid_user_response\",\n    \"errorMessage\": \"\",\n    \"parameters\": null\n}\n```\n## TOKENPUSH\n### Get users authenticators\nThe first step is to submit a POST request to get all of the authenticators that can be used to log in to your application. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"userId\":\"jsmith\",\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\"}\n```\nAn API response is received after entering the response. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"availableSecondFactor\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": {\n        \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n        \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n        \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n        \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n    },\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"authenticationTypes\": [\n        \"TOKENPUSH\",\n        \"TOKEN\",\n        \"OTP\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": 1521485688570,\n    \"otpDeliveryInfo\": {\n        \"otpDefaultDelivery\": \"SMS\",\n        \"availableOTPDelivery\": [\n            \"SMS\",\n            \"EMAIL\",\n            \"VOICE\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\nTOKENPUSH is listed as one of the user's available authenticators (**authenticationTypes**) in the example above.\n\n### Select Authenticator\n\nThe next step is to send a POST request to use token push authentication. Send the request to a URL with TOKENPUSH at the end. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users/authenticate/TOKENPUSH\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the application being accessed. The body of this request may also include transaction details, as described above. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"userId\":\"jsmith\",\n    \"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\",\n    \"transactionDetails\":[\n\t    {\"detail\":\"Amount\",\"value\":\"$10,001\"},\n    \t{\"detail\":\"Purpose\",\"value\":\"Transfer\"}\n    ],\n}\n```\nAn API response is received after entering the request. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"status\": null,\n    \"firstName\": null,\n    \"lastName\": null,\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": false,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": {\n        \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n        \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n        \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n        \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n    },\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": \"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\",\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n    \"expires\": 1521484056513,\n    \"time\": 1521483156531\n}\n```\n### Complete Authentication challenge\nThe user receives a push notification to the device registered with the Entrust Soft Token mobile application. The last step is to complete the authentication process using the token push authenticator. Note that in the push authentication case, there is no response that must be passed to the last API call. The post request should be sent to this API call:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/authentication/users/authenticate/TOKENPUSH/complete\n```\nAs in the first example, this request will also include an Authorization header field.\n\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\"}\n```\nAn API response to the request is received. The response will vary depending on whether the user has completed the push authentication challenge or not. For example, if the user has not yet processed the request, the API response appears as shown:\n```\n{\n    \"status\": \"NO_RESPONSE\",\n    \"firstName\": null,\n    \"lastName\": null,\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": false,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": null,\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": null,\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n    \"expires\": 0,\n    \"time\": 1521485352309\n}\n```\nIf the user selected a **Confirm** response for the push request, the API response appears as shown:\n```\n{\n    \"status\": \"CONFIRM\",\n    \"firstName\": \"John\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": true,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": null,\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": \"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\",\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n    \"expires\": 1521486237824,\n    \"time\": 1521485466748\n}\n```\nIf the user selected a **Cancel** response for the push request, the API response appears as shown:\n```\n{\n    \"errorCode\": \"no_transaction\",\n    \"errorMessage\": \"\",\n    \"parameters\": null\n}\n```\n## Two-factor Authentication\nTwo-factor authentication supports logging in by completing two-authentication challenges instead of one. This section describes how to use IntelliTrust's Authentication APIs to complete two-factor authentication. The API calls required are similar to those required for single-factor authentication:\n\n 1. Get User's Authenticators\n 2. Select Authenticator (First-factor)\n 3. Complete Authentication Challenge (First-factor)\n 4. Select Authenticator (Second-factor)\n 5. Complete Authentication Challenge (Second-factor)\n\n### Get User's Authenticators\n\nThe first step is to submit a POST request to get all of the authenticators that can be used. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"userId\":\"jsmith\",\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\"}\n```\nAn API response to the request is received. The response would include **authenticationTypes** marked as **PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR**. It would also include the section **availableSecondFactor**, showing all the authenticators that can be used for second-factor authentication. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"availableSecondFactor\": [\n        \"TOKENPUSH\",\n        \"TOKEN\",\n        \"OTP\"\n    ],\n    \"userMachineSettings\": {\n        \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n        \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n        \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n        \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n    },\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"authenticationTypes\": [\n        \"PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": 1521647783740,\n    \"otpDeliveryInfo\": {\n        \"otpDefaultDelivery\": \"SMS\",\n        \"availableOTPDelivery\": [\n            \"SMS\",\n            \"EMAIL\",\n            \"VOICE\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n### Select Authenticator (First-factor)\nThe next step is to send a POST request to use first-factor authentication. It must be sent to a URL with PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR at the end of it. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users/authenticate/PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"userId\":\"jsmith\",\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\"}\n```\nAn API response is received after entering the request. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"status\": null,\n    \"firstName\": null,\n    \"lastName\": null,\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": false,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": {\n        \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": false,\n        \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n        \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n        \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n    },\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": \"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\",\n    \"expires\": 1521648764763,\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n    \"time\": 1521647864782\n}\n```\n### Complete authentication challenge (First-factor)\nThe next step is to complete the first-factor authentication challenge. For an example, a POST request to complete a Password authentication challenge would be sent to the following URL:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/authentication/users/authenticate/PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR/complete\n```\nAs in the first example, this request will also include an Authorization header field.\n\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with the password response and the ID of the application being accessed. For example:\n```\n{\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\",\"response\":\"password\"\n}\n```\nThe response received from this request would include a new token and a field **authenticationCompleted** that would be marked as false. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"status\": null,\n    \"firstName\": null,\n    \"lastName\": null,\n    \"authenticationCompleted\": false,\n    \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n    \"userMachineSettings\": {\n        \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n        \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n        \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n        \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n    },\n    \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n    \"token\": \"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\",\n    \"expires\": 1521648936739,\n    \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n    \"time\": 1521648060983\n}\n```\n### Select Authenticator (Second-factor)\nThe next step is to send a POST request to use a specific second-factor authentication. It must be sent to a URL with PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR at the end of it. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users/authenticate/PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR\n```\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with the ID of the application being accessed, the token that was received from the last request, and a second-factor authenticator. All the available second-factor authenticator options were received in the first call we made. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\",\n    \"secondFactorAuthenticator\":\"OTP\",\n    \"authToken\":\"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\"\n}\n```\nAn API response is received after entering the request.

It must be sent to a URL with PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR at the end of it. For example:\n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/authentication/users/authenticate/PASSWORD_AND_SECONDFACTOR/complete\n```\nAs in the first example, this request will also include an Authorization header field.\n\nThe body of this request should contain a JSON object with the second factor response, the ID of the application being accessed, and the second factor authenticator being used.

This indicates that two-factor authentication was successful.\n# How risk based authentication (RBA) and authentication APIs work together\n\nRisk-based authentication (RBA) identifies the level of risk associated with each authentication request. Once the risk level is identified, RBA defines the level of authentication required to authenticate.\n\nAn authentication request consists of three API calls (as described above):\n\n - Get User's Authenticators\n - Select Authenticator  \n - Complete Authentication Challenge\n\nAs part of figuring out what authentications are available and required, each application's resource rule uses RBA to determine the request's risk level.  The risk levels possible are low, medium, and high. The risk level of the request defines which authenticators can be used. The following factors are considered when determining the request's risk level:\n\n 1. Date and time of request\n 2. Location of request\n 3. Source IP address of request origin\n 4. Machine Authentication (described in the next section)\n 5. Location history of authentication requests received\n 6. Travel velocity of authentication requests received\n\n## Machine Authentication\n\nMachine authentication is one of the factors used to evaluate each request's risk. Entrust Datacard recommends downloading the Entrust IdentityGuard Device Fingerprint SDKs from TrustedCare for machine authentication. The SDK collects the device fingerprint and includes it as part of the machine authentication.  \n\nThe risk condition generates a risk score by completing the following steps:\n1. The IntelliTrust user's Web Browser assigned the Machine Authenticator generates a machine secret. It includes these components:\n\t - Machine nonce: A value generated when the machine authenticator is registered and stored by the client.\n\t - Sequence nonce: Another value generated in a previous authentication attempt that is stored by the client.  Unlike a machine nonce, the sequence nonce is modified every time an authentication API call is made.\n\t - Device fingerprint – A value collected from the client device.\n\n2. The machine secret is submitted to IntelliTrust in the query request.\n\n3. The machine secret is compared to machine secrets from previous authentication requests to determine a risk level.\n\n4. At the end of a successful authentication, a machine nonce and sequence nonce may be returned to the client. In that case, the client should store these values for future authentication attempts.\n\nBelow are example use cases for Machine Authentication:\n-\tAuthentication from a new Web Browser that normally requires two factor authentication. A resource rule could be configured to allow users to log by only completing a single-factor authentication if a valid Machine Authenticator is detected.\n-\tAuthentication from a previously-used machine that normally only requires password authentication. The application's resource rule would need to be customized to support Machine Authentication. For example, a resource rule would be customized as follows to consider Machine Authentication and only require password authentication:\n\t-\tCustomize the risk score assigned to users who do not have a Machine Authenticator\n\t-\tCustomize the risk assigned to users who do have a Machine Authenticator\n\t-\tSet low risk authentication to **PASSWORD + NONE**\n\t-\tMedium risk authentication to **PASSWORD + OTP**\n\n## EXTERNAL plus Second-factor authentication\nIn this type of authentication, a client has already completed the first factor authentication outside of IntelliTrust and uses IntelliTrust to determine if second-factor authentication is necessary.\n\nThis section describes how to use the IntelliTrust's Authentication APIs to complete, if required, second-factor authentication.\nThe API calls required are similar to those required for single-factor authentication:\n\n 1. Get User's Authenticators\n 2. Complete EXTERNAL Authentication (the result indicates if second-factor is required)\n 3. Select Authenticator (Second-factor)\n 4. Complete Authentication Challenge (Second-factor)\n \nNotes:\n-\tIf the Authentication API application is configured such that the client doesn't require to perform second-factor authentication, the client will receive an authenticated JWT in step 2.\n-\tTo use some of the risk conditions, the client IP address must be made available to IntelliTrust in all requests. You define the source of the client IP address when the Authentication API application is created.  The examples below assume that you selected **Provided in the API**.\n\n ### Get User's Authenticators\n\n The first step is to submit a POST request to get all of the authenticators that can be used. For example:\n ```\n https://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users\n ```\n The body of this request should contain a JSON object with User ID (containing the user id or a user alias value) and the ID of the Authentication API application being accessed. For example:\n ```\n {\"userId\":\"jsmith\", \"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\", \"clientIp\": \"1.2.3.4\"}\n ```\n A response with a JSON object to the API request is received. The response includes the **authenticationTypes** attribute marked as **EXTERNAL**. It also includes the **availableSecondFactor** attribute showing all the authenticators that can be used for second-factor authentication. For example:\n ```\n {\n     \"availableSecondFactor\": [\n         \"TOKENPUSH\",\n         \"TOKEN\",\n         \"OTP\"\n     ],\n     \"userMachineSettings\": {\n         \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n         \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n         \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n         \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n     },\n     \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n     \"authenticationTypes\": [\n         \"EXTERNAL\"\n     ],\n     \"time\": 1521647783740,\n     \"otpDeliveryInfo\": {\n         \"otpDefaultDelivery\": \"SMS\",\n         \"availableOTPDelivery\": [\n             \"SMS\",\n             \"EMAIL\",\n             \"VOICE\"\n         ]\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n ### Complete first-factor authentication\n The next step is to complete the first-factor EXTERNAL authentication to determine if second-factor authentication is required. A POST request to complete the EXTERNAL authentication challenge would be sent to the following URL:\n ```\n https://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/authentication/users/authenticate/EXTERNAL/complete\n ```\n As in the first example, this request will also include an Authorization header field.\n\n The body of this request should contain a JSON object with the ID of the API application being accessed. For example:\n ```\n {\"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\", \"clientIp\": \"1.2.3.4\"}\n ```\n The response received from this request would include a new token and the **authenticationCompleted** attribute that would be marked as false. For example:\n ```\n {\n     \"status\": null,\n     \"firstName\": null,\n     \"lastName\": null,\n     \"authenticationCompleted\": false,\n     \"machineAuthenticator\": null,\n     \"userMachineSettings\": {\n         \"machineAuthenticatorEnabled\": true,\n         \"deviceFingerprintRequired\": false,\n         \"attributeExclusions\": [],\n         \"userMachineAuthenticators\": []\n     },\n     \"kbaChallenge\": null,\n     \"token\": \"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\",\n     \"expires\": 1521648936739,\n     \"otpdeliveryType\": null,\n     \"time\": 1521648060983\n }\n ```\n If the Authentication API application is configured in a such a way that users with low risk score do not require to perform second-factor authentication, in this step the user would be authenticated and the response would set **authenticationCompleted** as true indicating that EXTERNAL plus second-factor authentication was successful.\n\n ### Select Authenticator (Second-factor)\n The next step is to send a POST request to use a specific second-factor authentication. All the available second-factor authenticator options were received in the first call we made. For example, with OTP, the request URL would be:\n ```\n https://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/authentication/users/authenticate/OTP\n ```\n The body of this request should contain a JSON object with the ID of the Authentication API application being accessed and the token that was received from the last request. For example:\n ```\n {\n     \"applicationId\":\"1111111-111111-111111-11111111\",\n     \"clientIp\": \"1.2.3.4\",\n     \"authToken\": \"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\"\n }\n ```\n An API response is received after submitting the request.
