This API allows you to seamlessly perform administrative actions on IntelliTrust without logging in to the IntelliTrust Administrator portal.\n# Prerequisites\nConfirm the following before executing the Admin API calls included in this guide:\n - An Admin API application has been created on your IntelliTrust account. The application must be configured with a role that has the permissions needed by your application. IntelliTrust allows you to download a JSON file once the application is created.\n - The Application ID and Shared Secret parameter values are easily accessible. They must be entered into the body of the Admin APi request. The required values are displayed after creating the Administration API application on IntelliTrust. Upon creation, you can either copy these values to your clipboard or download them as a JSON file.\n - The Admin API application configuration data has been downloaded and is available for use.\n\n# IntelliTrust Administration APIs\nIntelliTrust administration APIs are grouped into the following categories. You can only perform the API calls permitted by the role assigned to your Administration API application on IntelliTrust. See the **IntelliTrust Administrator Help** for more information on IntelliTrust roles:\n ### Admin Authentication\nThese APIs facilitate authentication between your Admin API application and IntelliTrust. You must make this call before making any other Admin API calls. The call generates an authentication token value that must be included in all other Admin API requests.\n\nThe Admin API authentication response includes the token's expiration time. For instance:\n```\n    \"authToken\": \"GLrKMuDGiIWPJooDRFTZIHc65RyjJBiPdy4b5xNR8fKxXfwy4tbSIvh+xiFHlJ2p6tm3FuOZ34sxjCHYbDa77eLrxFcMuwYjRMmLWsUIGfkpfg33Wb/5X01Xag4Vdjz5DpVKfCg/OL2rnd4tfCfzM9FoY+vY/sllGgRtQkGeZodsi+QvazqQS1iJ5e6i5ouR05P52YsLgmMlZ4mUfH3JiXZmkkAJvXuM3oj9msi/a4ULWeUGYW5oHM5Gs6ab37baa5xzVykzowHdIoZMVeC8+zVqDr+yXTAHVysBYQHngyckgBizDc2g49RgRTEz2k+yRIvwUU5swGzKtgt6kYtyyFM8YdeODB59Fkl8w5mQQDpxIyZcclCFv2C+MBWdnbM0kJIgNtE1ZeRA+zxwS6avE8EKw3T9Nczs6KBfycV3NxgxTvTQIxNi3kPA8XdJtAmCkUR/gyLkqJXk7bGDvFo4+rWR4uX2XxHm2NZGTNA1QezK96Y7JVjImfoHlUJnxGm207/kVPIVtSUD+6XuEl0uVvrtnTPmQnpq3P0gTYvon3Cw1caQvIydtrUv4yfs4Q/WVvSF3GQh3uet/IkUeGbkxLn43CSVz2hCQoeF8jxIoiJuSAxs1e3phylp0plijvok01Tbit6um/x4tK5UZYCRZYmeSD/ltXGtZNOoA4YHh5cDK+KcDy2tuWaexi2Hf+nJ5adqiMHwuozIH69Eqc6OZ9o86t75mIdux8zLgWt0T3SFOphtCvF0L8BdxICrEXGMDhguRRH7f+/IPU0ggFwnxsIV2a3c4oOayFfHwVSg4rGSKfWuWtkfNavA8RI5y6JOKzMrulrdg+gzuBMms2nKn38HNIRu2pKMVzQ2jU8CrtPgOT8=\",\n    \"expirationTime\": \"2020-01-23T16:30:58Z\",\n    \"creationTime\": \"2020-01-23T16:15:58Z\"\n}\n```\nIf you use this authentication token to make requests after it expires, the service will return an UNAUTHORIZED response code (401) and you will need to reauthenticate to obtain a new token.\n\nSome workarounds to prevent this are:\n- Always reauthenticate before making a request; or\n- Track the expiration time and reauthenticate when you detect that it has expired; or\n- Send an OPTIONS request to the same end-point to detect whether the token has expired. This can be useful with end-points receiving a large payload such as images where the token can expire before the request has completed. In these cases the request may fail with a 500 error.\n\nWhen an admin API application authenticates, there is an option to enable a web session to add additional security to the session.  This is done by setting the enableWebSession argument passed to the authentication controller to true.  When a web session is enabled, a HTTP session cookie named INTELLITRUST_SESSION_ID will be returned with the authentication results.  This cookie must be included with all subsequent admin API calls along with the authentication token.\n ### Users \nThese APIs facilitate user management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Smart Credentials\nThe Entrust Datacard® Mobile Smart Credential (MSC) application allows users to perform authentications to their IntelliTrust account and configured applications. This API call facilitates mobile smart credential management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Tokens\nThese APIs facilitate hardware and soft token management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### FIDO2 Tokens\n These APIs faciliate management of FIDO2 tokens.  FIDO2 tokens cannot be registered using the administration API but they can be viewed, deleted and updated.\n ### Grid Cards\n Grid authentication uses cards with a grid as the authentication lookup tool. This API call facilitates Grid Card management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Temporary Access Codes\nTemporary Access Codes can be used to log in when a user cannot access their one-time passcode (OTP), Grid Card, or token authenticator. This API call facilitates Temporary Access Code management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### KBA - Knowledge-based Authenticators\nKnowledge-based authentication (or knowledge-based authenticators) (KBA) (also known as question-and-answer (Q&A) authentication) allows users to authenticate to SAML application accounts using IntelliTrust by providing the correct answer to one or more preregistered questions. This API call facilitates Knowledge-based Authenticator management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Passwords\nThere are two types of password authenticators available on IntelliTrust —IntelliTrust passwords and Active Directory (AD) passwords. IntelliTrust passwords are passwords that can be manually or automatically assigned to users on IntelliTrust. Active Directory (AD) passwords are passwords that have already been assigned to a user on their corporate directory - not through IntelliTrust. This API call facilitates password management operations on an IntelliTrust account for either type of password.\n ### OTPs\nThese APIs facilitate OTP management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### User Risk-based authentication (RBA) Settings\n Risk-based authentication (RBA) identifies the level of risk associated with a user who tries to authenticate. This API call facilitates Risk-based authentication management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Machine authenticators\nMachine Authentication (MA) provides identification information on the Web browser being used to access a SAML application. This API call facilitates Machine Authenticator management operations on an IntelliTrust account. \n ### User Attributes\nUser attributes are the information fields listed as part of each user's Profile information. This API call facilitates user attribute management operations on an IntelliTrust account. \n ### Roles\nRoles control what operations a user can perform on their IntelliTrust account. These roles distinguish the amount of access given to each account, ranging from administrators with full access to end users (who can only access the user portal features).This API call facilitates role management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Groups\nAn IntelliTrust group is a collection of users given access to applications based on the resource rules they are assigned to. This API call facilitates group management operations on an IntelliTrust account.\n ### Reports\nThese APIs allows you to access the Audit Log on your IntelliTrust account. This Log lists the actions performed on your account within a period of time.\n ### Settings\n These APIs provide management of the settings used to configure IntelliTrust behavior.  Settings that can be managed using the administration API include General settings, OTP settings and Token settings.\n ### Applications\n These APIs provide management of authentication API applications using the administration API.\n ### Resource Rules\n Resource rules define what authenticators are required to authenticate to an application.  The resource rules APIs provide management of resource rules using the administration API.\n ### Directories\n These APIs provide directory related information using the administration API.\n ### Tenants\n For service provider accounts, the tenant APIs provide management of their child tenants as well as mangement of entitlements for those tenants. These APIs are only available for accounts that are service providers.\n ### Account Info\n The account info APIs provide functionality to fetch and modify account related information such as the company name and the license acknowledged flag.\n ### ActiveSync Access\n These APIs facilitate management of Exchange ActiveSync Devices available on your Microsoft Office 365 account.\n ### ID Proofing\nThese APIs are used to validate the identity of a person by performing a liveness check using a government-issued identity document, such as a driver's license or a passport, and comparing the document photograph with a self-portrait digital photograph (selfie) taken on a mobile device.\n\n# Examples\nThe following are examples of Admin API calls that can be used to perform administrative actions. The examples below are not an exhaustive list of possible Admin API actions. \n\n**Important:** You must execute the Authentication (Admin API) call before executing any other Admin API calls. The Authentication (Admin API) call generates a token value that must be included in every other request to be successful.\n\n## Authentication (Admin API)\nTo perform this action, the first step is to submit a POST request to the Admin application. This is the Admin application created on your IntelliTrust account. The URL address of the Admin application includes your IntelliTrust account URL. The format of the URL is:  \n```  \nhttps://<domainname>.<region>.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/adminapi/authenticate  \n```  \nFor example:  \n```  \nhttps://example.us.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/adminapi/authenticate  \n```  \nThe body of this request should contain the JSON object with an Application ID and Shared Secret. This JSON file was generated during creation of Admin Application on IntelliTrust. For example:  \n```  \n{\t\"applicationId\": \"d3737e0f-4d8e-431c-b1d8-cd17ad4d633d\",\"sharedSecret\": \"randomSharedSecret\"}  \n```\nAn API response is received if the call is successful . For example:\n```\n{\n    \"authToken\": \"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\",\n    \"expirationTime\": \"2018-05-28T19:07:50.328+0000\",\n    \"creationTime\": \"2018-05-28T18:52:50.329+0000\"\n}\n```\nYou must include the **auth token** value displayed in this response in subsequent API calls. Without it, other Admin API calls will fail.\n\nAn error code is displayed if the call is unsuccessful. A different error code is displayed for each type of error.\n## Users\n### Create A User\nSubmit a POST request to create a User on your account. \nThe format of the URL is:  \n```  \nhttps://<domainname>.<region>.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/users\n```   \nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as **token** in the authentication request. The body of this request must contain all the fields mentioned in the example below that are configured as mandatory: \n```\n{\n   \"firstName\":\"john\",\n   \"lastName\":\"smith\",\n   \"email\":\"johnsmith@organization.com\",\n   \"userId\":\"john\",\n   \"mobile\":\"+16138561234\",\n   \"phone\":\"+161385699876\",\n   \"locale\":\"\",\n   \"state\":\"ACTIVE\",\n   \"externaId\":null,\n   \"externalSource\":null,\n   \"userAttributeValues\":[\n   ],\n   \"userAliases\": [\n      {\n         \"value\": \"johnny\",\n         \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\n      }\n   ]   \n}\n```\nIn this example, all the required input parameters have been provided. The request would succeed and generate a response that includes all the details of the create user. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"2c422a2f-e8ae-4af8-8b03-e1ce0ddde0b0\",\n    \"userId\": \"john\",\n    \"firstName\": \"john\",\n    \"lastName\": \"smith\",\n    \"email\": \"johnsmith@organization.com\",\n    \"mobile\": \"+16138561234\",\n    \"phone\":\"+161385699876\",\n    \"locale\": null,\n    \"state\": \"ACTIVE\",\n    \"externalId\": null,\n    \"externalSource\": null,\n    \"migrated\": null,\n    \"locked\": false,\n    \"lockoutExpiry\": null,\n    \"otpCreateTime\": null,\n    \"grids\": [],\n    \"tokens\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"9a2edcc5-46f0-4fff-89b1-13c0f73e1a5c\",\n            \"type\": \"ENTRUST_SOFT_TOKEN\",\n            \"serialNumber\": \"62461-69384\",\n            \"loadDate\": \"2018-05-29T19:12:54.000+0000\",\n            \"lastUsedDate\": null,\n            \"state\": \"ACTIVATING\",\n            \"platform\": null,\n            \"registeredForTransactions\": false,\n            \"name\": null,\n            \"allowedActions\": [\n                \"REACTIVATE\",\n                \"ACTIVATE_COMPLETE\",\n                \"DELETE\"\n            ],\n            \"description\": null,\n            \"userId\": null\n        }\n    ],\n    \"smartCredentials\": [],\n    \"tempAccessCode\": null,\n    \"userAttributeValues\": [],\n    \"userAliases\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"43422a2f-e8ae-4af8-8b03-e1ce0ddde0b0\",\n            \"userId\": \"c633a710-70bd-411e-86be-e1898f1b19f5\",\n            \"value\": \"johnny\",\n            \"type\": \"CUSTOM\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"2c422a2f-e8ae-4af8-8b03-e1ce0ddde0b0\",\n            \"userId\": \"c633a710-70bd-411e-86be-e1898f1b19f5\",\n            \"value\": \"john\",\n            \"type\": \"USERID\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"groups\": [],\n    \"type\": \"MGMT_UI\"\n}\n```\n### Get a User by UserID\nSubmit a POST request to retrieve user details for a particular User Id. The format of the URL is:  \n```  \nhttps://<domainname>.<region>.trustedauth.com/api/web/v2/users/userid\n```  \nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as **token** in the authentication request. The body of this request must contain **UserID**. For example:\n```\n{\"userId\":\"John\"}\n``` \nIn this example, all the required input parameters have been provided. The request would succeed and generate a response that includes the user's information.

You must include the Grid Card's ID string in the request. The ID is required to identify which Grid Card's details to display. The format of the request URL is:  \n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/users/grids/{gridid}\n```\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://example.us.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/users/grids/6c5ad3b4-888c-4d3b-88f2-8ab71ae4f917\n```\nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as \"token\" in the authentication request. \n\nIn this example, all the required input parameters have been provided. The request would succeed and generate a response that includes Grid Card details. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"6c5ad3b4-888c-4d3b-88f2-8ab71ae4f917\",\n    \"serialNumber\": 2,\n    \"createDate\": \"2018-05-29T19:48:24.000+0000\",\n    \"assignDate\": null,\n    \"expiryDate\": null,\n    \"expired\": false,\n    \"lastUsedDate\": null,\n    \"state\": \"ACTIVE\",\n    \"gridContents\": [\n        [\n            \"TP\",\n            \"0M\",\n            \"P8\",\n            \"KW\",\n            \"3D\",\n            \"KR\",\n            \"M1\",\n            \"W0\",\n            \"TJ\",\n            \"F4\"\n        ],\n        [\n            \"9M\",\n            \"MV\",\n            \"88\",\n            \"DX\",\n            \"H3\",\n            \"DV\",\n            \"44\",\n            \"PW\",\n            \"V1\",\n            \"CX\"\n        ],\n        [\n            \"F2\",\n            \"FE\",\n            \"0Q\",\n            \"XN\",\n            \"CD\",\n            \"36\",\n            \"MQ\",\n            \"PN\",\n            \"WF\",\n            \"DD\"\n        ],\n        [\n            \"WN\",\n            \"9F\",\n            \"J4\",\n            \"TF\",\n            \"7J\",\n            \"W4\",\n            \"7M\",\n            \"9Q\",\n            \"1H\",\n            \"W5\"\n        ],\n        [\n            \"QM\",\n            \"21\",\n            \"VQ\",\n            \"39\",\n            \"1N\",\n            \"EV\",\n            \"PT\",\n            \"P4\",\n            \"28\",\n            \"WY\"\n        ]\n    ],\n    \"allowedActions\": [\n        \"DELETE\",\n        \"DISABLE\"\n    ],\n    \"userId\": \"2c422a2f-e8ae-4af8-8b03-e1ce0ddde0b0\",\n    \"userName\": \"john\"\n}\n```\n## ID Proofing\n### Initiate an ID Proofing Transaction\nSubmit a POST request to initiate the transaction and obtain the mobile SDK license. You must include a device fingerprint in the request if the service is configured to require it. The format of the request URL is:  \n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/init\n```\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://example.us.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/init\n```\nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as \"token\" in the authentication request: \n```\n{\n\t\"clientIp\": \"1.2.3.4\",\n\t\"firstPartyBlackbox\": \"0610Jy4JhpaIbhJOJAyOFS...CpysKGn9rI0cgfvRE=\"\n}\n```\n> Checking the reputation of a device using a fingerprint is not supported in this release.\n>\nIn this example, the request would succeed and generate a response that includes the license. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"requestId\": \"0ba70f09-58c8-4a8e-bb87-cf98f4f4c111\",\n    \"deviceCheckResult\": \"ALLOW\",\n    \"deviceCheckReason\": \"\",\n    \"deviceCheckDetails\": {\n        \"device.alias\": \"115993746090684075\",\n        \"device.bb.age\": \"9756913\",\n        \"device.bb.timestamp\": \"2019-09-24T13:56:53Z\",\n        \"device.firstseen\": \"2019-09-19T14:01:06.004Z\",\n        \"device.flash.storage.enabled\": \"0\",\n        \"device.js.enabled\": \"0\",\n        \"device.new\": \"0\",\n        \"device.os\": \"IPHONE 12.4.1\",\n        \"device.type\": \"IPHONE\",\n        ...\n    },\n    \"subscriberId\": \"5f5edd7f-bf52-4c4e-6da3-56a278148bbe\",\n    \"subscriberAccount\": \"example@company.com\",\n    \"subscriberPassword\": \"xyz34@19fdjt&sw2\",\n    ...\n}\n```\nNote the requestId attribute returned. This value must be used in the following interactions with the service.\n\nIf a fingerprint is provided (firstPartyBlackbox attribute in the request) and the deviceCheckResult attribute value is DENY, then the transaction cannot be continued.\n\n### Upload the Front Side Image of a Document ID\nSubmit a PUT request to upload the front image of a supported document ID. The format of the request URL is:  \n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/<requestId>/image/0\n```\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://example.us.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/a63b0b66-1d1d-4834-b393-38a52c5e8304/image/0\n```\nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as \"token\" in the authentication request. \n\nThe binary image must be submitted in the body of the HTTP request.\n> If the authentication token has expired and the image is very large, the response sometimes can be a generic Internal Error (500) instead of UNAUTHORIZED (401).  To prevent this, it's recommended to submit an OPTIONS request before submitting the PUT request with the image.  The OPTIONS request will always return UNAUTHORIZED (401) if the authentication token is expired.\n>\n\nIn this example, the image is successfully classified into a well-known document class. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"presentationChanged\": false,\n    \"documentClass\": \"DRIVERSLICENSE\",\n    \"countryCode\": \"USA\",\n    \"supportedFrontImage\": true,\n    \"supportedBackImage\": true\n}\n```\nIf the documentClass attribute value is UNKNOWN, then you need to upload a better image to continue.\n\n### Upload the Back Side Image of a Document ID\nIf the response after submitting a valid Front image includes the \"supportedBackImage\" attribute with value \"true\", then you can submit a PUT request to upload the back image of a supported document ID. The format of the request URL is:\n\nNote that uploading the back of a document is optional as in some cases all the relevant information is available in the front of the document.  \n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/<requestId>/image/1\n```\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://example.us.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/a63b0b66-1d1d-4834-b393-38a52c5e8304/image/1\n```\nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as \"token\" in the authentication request. \n\nThe binary image must be submitted in the body of the HTTP request.\n> If the authentication token has expired and the image is very large, the response sometimes can be a generic Internal Error (500) instead of UNAUTHORIZED (401).  To prevent this, it's recommended to submit an OPTIONS request before submitting the PUT request with the image.  The OPTIONS request will always return UNAUTHORIZED (401) if the authentication token is expired.\n>\nIn this example, the image is successfully classified into a well-known document class. For example:\n```\n{\n    \"presentationChanged\": false,\n    \"documentClass\": \"DRIVERSLICENSE\",\n    \"countryCode\": \"USA\",\n    \"supportedFrontImage\": true,\n    \"supportedBackImage\": true\n}\n```\nIf the documentClass attribute value is UNKNOWN, then you need to upload a better image to continue.\n\n### Complete an ID Proofing Transaction using an Standard Facial Recognition License\nIf you are using an Standard Facial Recognition license and the document images uploaded in the previous requests classified correctly, you can now submit a PUT request to upload the selfie that the mobile SDK takes.\n \n```\nhttps://customer.region.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/<requestId>/completeselfie\n```\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://example.us.trustedauth.com/api/web/v1/idproofing/a63b0b66-1d1d-4834-b393-38a52c5e8304/completeselfie\n```\nAn Authorization header field must be included in the header section of this request. The Authorization header stores the value received as \"token\" in the authentication request. \n<p>\nThe binary selfie image must be submitted in the body of the HTTP request.\n\nIn this example, the selfie matches the document ID photo (faceMatch true) but document ID authentication indicates ATTENTION as one of the tests performed on the document didn't PASS--see documentTestResults:\n```\n{\n    \"faceMatch\": true,\n    \"faceMatchScore\": 84,\n    \"documentAuthenticationResult\": \"ATTENTION\",\n    \"documentDataFields\": [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"The person's legal,
